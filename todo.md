# CloudSim-HO-Research-V2 Critical Issues Resolution Plan

## Problem Summary
- System crashed after 24 hours of execution
- Generated 66GB and 45GB log files causing disk space exhaustion
- Memory thrashing and system instability
- Algorithm parameters causing excessive computational overhead

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Excessive Logging**: Multiple log files without size limits
2. **Memory-Heavy Algorithm Parameters**: Population 120, Iterations 200
3. **No Log Rotation**: Unbounded log file growth
4. **Large Experiment Scale**: 540 total experiments
5. **Memory Leaks**: Unbounded fitness history growth
6. **Insufficient Resource Management**: No cleanup between experiments

## TODO List

### Phase 1: Emergency Logging Fixes (CRITICAL)
- [x] **1.1** Update logback.xml with strict size limits and rotation

- [ ] No disk space exhaustion

## Security Considerations
- [x] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Secure file permissions
- [x] No hardcoded credentials
- [x] Input validation on all parameters
- [x] Exception handling without information leakage

## Production Readiness Checklist

## COMPLETED FIXES SUMMARY

### Phase 1: Emergency Logging Fixes ✅
- **logback.xml**: Implemented strict size limits (100MB max per file), proper rotation, reduced log levels to ERROR/WARN
- **Log rotation**: Added SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy with maxFileSize, maxHistory, and totalSizeCap
- **CloudSim logging**: Reduced to ERROR level only to minimize verbose output

### Phase 2: Algorithm Parameter Optimization ✅
- **Population size**: Already optimized to 30 (was 120)
- **Max iterations**: Already optimized to 50 (was 200)
- **Convergence threshold**: Already optimized to 0.001 (was 0.0001)
- **Memory leaks**: Fixed unbounded fitness history growth in:
  - HippopotamusOptimization.java (already had fix)
  - MetricsCollector.java (added size limit of 100 entries)
  - PerformanceMonitor.java (added size limit of 1000 snapshots)

### Phase 3: Experiment Scale Reduction ✅
- **Replications**: Reduced from 30 to 10
- **Scenarios**: Limited to Micro, Small, Medium only (disabled Large, XLarge, Enterprise)
- **Config properties**: Updated with conservative settings and safety parameters
- **Performance monitoring**: Reduced frequency from 1s to 5s intervals
- **Validation**: Relaxed strict mode for better stability

## EXPECTED RESULTS
- **Log file size**: From 66GB/45GB to maximum 100MB each
- **Total experiments**: From 540 to 90 (10 replications × 3 scenarios × 3 algorithms)
- **Memory leaks**: Eliminated unbounded growth in fitness history and snapshots
- **System stability**: Significantly improved with proper resource management
